| Day | Status |
|-----|--------|
|  [1](scripts/01.fsx)  |   OK, Second part took ages     |
|  [2](scripts/02.fsx)  |   Very horrible code for Part 2  esp.    |
|  [3](scripts/03.fsx)  |   Spent a HUGE amount of time on this   |
|  [4](scripts/04.fsx)  |   Run out of time to do part 2, maybe later   |
|  [5](scripts/05.fsx)  |   Some *bad* code. Part 1 OK, part 2 memory leak or something 🔥  |
|  [6](scripts/06.fsx)  |   OK, eventually |
|  [7](scripts/07.fsx)  |  part One only, using totally unsuitable approach |
